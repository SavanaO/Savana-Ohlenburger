I have worked for almost a decade in healthcare and my experience with TripleTen learning SQL, Advanced Spreadsheets, and Tableau has enhanced my analytical abilities to match my inquisitive attitude and attention to detail. My work experience has allowed me to hone my time management and communication skills. Some facts about me:
   -I train my dog and workout in my free time
   -I am currently running a virtual marathon with my sister on Conqueror Challenges
   -I love crafts and have about a million unfinished projects (as any amateur enthusiast does) and eventually I will finish making my own costume for the Renaissance Festival!
   -I love to bake and am lucky enough to have neighbors that like to eat
   -My goal for 2024 is to land my dream analyst job </p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PVURjTONJM8N0YZwskdc0osSrzsh8GMzJ4VkfRVVGI/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
